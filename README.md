### Description
This project pretend to be an organized way to construct
machine learning models. Including data processing, model
creation and performance validation.

#### Project status
At the moment the project is in development. We are working
in creating data_engineering module to process raw data and
show it in plots. We are also working in prediction_model
module which will create a ml model and train it using raw
data as an input.

#### Requirements on development environment
This project uses *sklearn* and *TensorFlow* for creating ML
models.
